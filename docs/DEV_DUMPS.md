# Dev dumps — general-purpose live-client debug capture

`AltArmy.Debug.Dump(label, payload)` (in [`AltArmy_TBC/Data/Debug.lua`](../AltArmy_TBC/Data/Debug.lua)) is a **standing tool**, not a one-off. Use it whenever a bug can only be understood from live client state (WoW APIs, SavedVariables shape on a real character, a private-server client that behaves differently than expected) and chat-log printing would be too slow or tedious for the person testing it.

Prefer this over ad hoc `print`/`DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage` debug logging whenever the data needed doesn't fit in a couple of short lines, or the person testing can't easily copy text out of the chat window.

## Why this exists instead of chat logging

Chat lines are hard to copy out of the WoW client and get truncated/interleaved when there's a lot of data. `Dump` instead writes a Lua table straight to SavedVariables, which an agent can read directly from disk after a `/reload` — no manual copy-paste, and full structured data (nested tables, full lists) instead of one-line summaries.

## How it works

- **Permanent, always safe to call.** `Dump` is a no-op unless master debug is on (`/altarmy debug on`), so leaving `AltArmy.Debug.Dump(...)` calls in committed code between debugging sessions costs nothing.
- **Keyed by label.** Each call's `payload` overwrites `AltArmyTBC_Options.debug.devDumps[label]` — pick a distinct label per call site so unrelated dumps don't clobber each other (e.g. two different searches happening in the same flow).
- **Center-screen alert.** Every successful dump shows a center-screen alert (`UIErrorsFrame`) reading `Alt Army dev dump: <label>`, so it's obvious to whoever is testing that a dump just fired — no need for them to check chat or guess whether their action was captured.

## Using it for a task

1. **Insert a call** at the point in the code where the interesting state exists, e.g.:
   ```lua
   AltArmy.Debug.Dump("recipeSearch", {
       query = query,
       scanned = scanned,
       results = someResultsSnapshot,
   })
   ```
   Build the payload out of plain tables/strings/numbers — it gets serialized into SavedVariables as-is. Snapshot only what's relevant to the current task (don't dump entire live objects with frames/functions in them).
2. **Ask the person testing** to:
   - Run `/altarmy debug on` (if not already on).
   - Reproduce the behavior (the alert confirms the dump fired).
   - Run `/reload`.
3. **Sync and read it yourself**:
   ```bash
   npm run dump:sync
   ```
   This copies the live SavedVariables file to `debug/compare-dump-source/AltArmy_TBC.lua` (see `.cursor/local.json` / `.cursor/local.json.example` for the source path). Then read `AltArmyTBC_Options.debug.devDumps.<label>` from that file directly (`rg -n "devDumps" debug/compare-dump-source/AltArmy_TBC.lua`, or open the file and search).
4. **Remove the call(s)** once the bug is understood — the payload/label are task-specific instrumentation, not something that should accumulate across many unrelated features. The `Dump`/`ShowCenterAlert` machinery itself stays in `Debug.lua` permanently for the next task.

## Multiple dump points in one investigation

If you need to capture state from more than one place at once (e.g. comparing what was scanned vs. what a search actually matched), just use different labels — they're stored independently in `devDumps` and none of them get evicted, so read them all after one repro + reload.

## Relationship to other dump tools

This is the **general-purpose** one. If you're specifically debugging the Gear tab's compare panel, use the purpose-built [`comparePanelDumps`](COMPARE_PANEL_DEBUG_DUMP.md) instead (has its own **Dump** button in the UI and a richer fixed schema). Reach for `AltArmy.Debug.Dump` for everything else.
